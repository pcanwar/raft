High-level approach:

Challenges:
Performance was our biggest challenge. We tried to simplify our design and look for any places
where performance could be affected by linear time operations, and tried to make them constant 
with dictionaries. We also tried to implementing gzip encoding but [result]

Testing:
We made sure to print urls that weren't valid while going through to see that we weren't going
off-site. We consistently checked for exceptions where they could reasonably be thrown and made
sure we weren't getting stuck in loops. We timed out our sockets properly 


Contributions:
We pair-programmed.
