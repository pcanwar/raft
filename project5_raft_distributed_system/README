High-level approach:
Split the project into different parts.
0. Implemented leader election, made sure it works before moving on to implementing
the next part
1. Implemented log replication
2. Improve performance by reducing number of messages sent between servers
3. Deal with partition

Challenges faced:
Debugging distributed systems is hard

An overview of how you tested your code:
Isolated code into different part. Created an isolated environment, which we could
understand. Tested code chunks in each individual environment and used print 
statements to make sure that the produced result is what we expected.
Wrote smaller programs that simulates the code, and tested the simulated program
carefully.
